              After Ragnorok occured, an event that caused the end of the worlds of Gods and Men, a handful the two
              beings found sanctuary at a place between time and space, a place where the effects of Ragnorok had not
              tainted, a place where they could start their new beginnings, a place that they could call 'Home'. This
              was given the name <strong>'Divine's Landing'</strong>
              <br>
              <br>
              However, Divine's Landing wasn't the only place which escaped the effects of Ragnorok, nor were their
              residents the only beings left alive. On a place given the nickname 'The Nether', resided the Japanese God
              of Destruction, 'Yato', with his hoarde of followers.
              <br>
              <br>
              Yato's only goal? Destroy and Enslave every living being in the universe so that he can rule over all of
              creation with an Iron Fist. Its up to the Residants of Divine's Landing, along with the God Hephaestus and
              Goddess Artimes, to protect themselves from Yato's evil reigns.
              <br>
              <br>
              It's up to you, the product of the two famous Greek Gods, to build up the defences of Divine's Landing and
              fend of the Rule of Yato before it becomes too late.

              In the year 2035, the City of Liyue is filled with technology which is far superior than anything the
              world has ever experienced before, where Mobile Transport such as Cars has become irrelevant. However, you
              can take mankind out of the Car, but you cannot take the Car out of mankind.
              <br>
              <br>
              Driving a car, let alone street racing, has become illegal in the City of Liyue, but that won't stop
              <strong>The Underground</strong> from doing as they please. The Underground, a well known community of
              Misfits, Bandits and Outlaws, is where Kennith Brown finds himself one day. After losing it all to the
              rich at a young age, he is taken in by the Leader of The Underground, Rick Mort, and is taught the ins and
              out of how to run the economy.
              <br>
              <br>
              Their goal? Bring down the government by any means necassary. Through hard work and dedication, Kenneth
              made his way to the top, and after the tragic death which befell Rick, Kennith became the Leader of the
              Underground.
              <br>
              <br>
              He finds himself stuck in a conflicting story of Family, Romance and Leadership, Kennith finds it
              extremely difficult to find a balance between it all. Will he be able to overthrow the Government and keep
              the people he cares about safe? Or will he cause the City of Liyue to fall?

              growing crops, excluded from the outside world. But suddenly, during the midst of a Blood Moon, the
              <strong>First Sun</strong> Appeared, And with it came unthinkable tradgedies."

              "Approximately 20% of all living creatures, be it Human, Plant or Animal, began mutating which birthed
              what we refer to today as unconcious Chimeras. Our Ancestors, those who had survived, had to pool together
              all their resources, and faced off the Original Chimera and brought peace to their village. However,
              before the first Sun had time to become legend, a decade later the <strong>Second Sun</strong> appeared,
              and with it, even more horrible mutations.
              <br>
              <br>

              "Although when the Sixth Sun appeared, a small margin of villagers discovered that they could wield the
              power of the mutations while retaining their conciousness, and thus, the League of Hero's was formed.
              After each decade, a Sun appeared, and a tournament was held amoungst the Hero's to determine who would
              fight in the war against the Chimera."

              In a world where Technological beings from a distant planet became dominant, humans find themselves on the
              brink of Extinction. These beings, given the name, 'the Precursors', have deduced that not only were
              humans unfit to reside on the planet Earth, but that humans in general were obsolete. With no technology
              inside, with limited knowledge and fragile bodies, the Precursors took it upon themselves to adopt
              humanity as humans would a stray cat.
              <br>
              <br>
              Naturally, though, Humans retaliated against the Precursors, angering their King who believed that they
              were protecting humanity from themselves. And as such, a decree was given amongst the Precursors to
              slaughter all humans who decided against the rule of the Precursors.
              <br>
              <br>
              A century later, after the Precursors took over Earth with an brutal rule, a half-breed between the
              Precursors and Humans emerged when a Precursor felt sorry for an orphaned baby and decided to give the
              child Precursor knowledge.
              <br>
              <br>
              The child, a young girl named Holly Mark, grew up to become a woman of drive and determination. She was a
              natural born laeder, and lived a normal life until her 25th Birthday where the effects of the Precursors'
              knowledge became apparent.
              <br>
              <br>
              On the run from deranged Scientists trying to extract her gift as well as strict and lethal Precursors,
              Holly finds herself struggling to decide whether she wants to become the Bridge between the two worlds, or
              the catalyst which insights both of their destruction.
