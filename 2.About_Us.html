                Hephaestus' Game Studio is a registered small time Development
                <br>
                For over five years, Hephaestus’ Games Studio has worked tirelessly
                <br>
                with various other companies and communities in order to Inspire the
                <br>
                youth as well as Indie Game Developers to further the development of
                <br>
                high quality videogames for all ages and platforms.
                <br>
                <br>
                In 2025, the founder of Hephaestus’ Games Studio, Zaheer Emeran, started
                <br>
                his dream of creating videogames completely by chance. He first attempted
                <br>
                to create a PC Game using premade asset packs, but eventually decided on
                <br>
                learning how to create his own 3D models. A year after, he proposed the
                <br>
                idea to his college friends, and from there Hephaestus’ Games Studio was
                <br>
                born.
                <br>
                <br>
                Over the years, he and his fellow workers worked tirelessly on learning
                <br>
                the art of Game Development while simultaneously balancing their College
                <br>
                lives. In the beginning it was difficult, but after tireless efforts, they
                <br>
                proved their skills and determination and managed start a Game Development
                <br>
                Club at their College. As a result, they scored sponsors from around South
                <br>
                Africa, and their business rapidly expanded, and once they had graduated,
                <br>
                they decided to work together to grow Hephaestus’ Game Studio.

								During the first year which Hephaestus' Games Studio officially launched, we had made major progress, far more than we had anticipated.
								<br>
								We had used the resources which were given to us through our leading Sponser, GameCorp, who had not only generously provided us with accomidation,
								<br>
								but also had given us resources such as capital, training etc. We were then able to move from our College Classroom to a small Studio Building in town, 
								<br>
								which we would then call home for the following five years.
								<br>
								<br>
								From there onwards, we grew our name by spending a few months creating our first, and most successful game, <strong>'Thirteenth Sun'
								<br>
								</strong> which promoted Hephaestus' Games Studios' name immensly. With over ten thousand downloads, the business grew in popularity and <br>
								allowed us not only a huge profit, but a personal emotion of accomplishment amongst the team over the year.

								After the huge success which <strong>'Thirteenth Sun'</strong> brought us, we not only recieved huge social media support, but we started extending further out
								<br>
								in order to attempt to help others via CSR Acts. It was at the beginning of 2021 when we began planning out what later would become <br>
								'Operation: Orphanos' and 'Operation: Young Minds'. It was around this time as well when we had achieved more sponsers which allowed<br>
								us to make far more progress in the creation of games than we would without them.
								<br>
								<br>
								During this year, we had created two games in total, namely <strong>'On Edge'</strong> and <strong>'Divines Landing'</strong>, which took half the total time that <strong>'Thirteenth Sun'</strong> took. 
								<br>
								These two games had a massive impact on our company as well, both reaching top 5 trending Indie Games on Steam for the month of November.
								<br>
								At the end of the year, we worked on improving our CSR Activities.

								It was here where when we had our first opportunity to work with the Highschool named <strong>'Little Hope Academy'</strong>. We sent our best team members
								<br>
								on a Wednesday and a Friday after school and worked tirelessly to provide the students with the best experience. We had a large turnover of students, 
								<br>
								approximately 25 Students, who had benefitted from our services. Not only had this proved to be beneficial for them, but it spread the word of our work 
								<br>
								hugely amongst other schools and students.
								<br>
								<br>
								At the end of the year, we had not only created the Underwater Horror game <strong>'Down Below'</strong>, but had improved the lives of those students by giving them the 
								<br>
								necassary skills in order to enter any career in the digital field, be it a Game Creator, Digital Artist etc. This year as well allowed us to generate a massive turnover 
								<br>
								in profits from both the four released games, as well as from the more sponsors which we recieved due to the ever increasing popularity of our business.

								At the beginning of this year, we had been blessed with the opportunity to work with five other schools, thus allowing us to implement <strong><br>
								'Operation: Young Minds'</strong> to its fullest capacity. We also, around Mid-Year, began laying the foundation for <strong>'Operation: Orphanos'</strong> which <br>
								we were planning to launch the following year. With the great success which 'Operation: Young Minds' brought us, we managed to land our second major <br>
								sponser, Blue Game Studio, which allowed us to hire more general workers for the team, as well as to upgrade our facilities immensly.
								<br>
								<br>
								During this year, contrary to our unspoken and unwritten trend, we hadn't released a Video Game. We rather focused on maintaining our<br>
								previously released games, as well as marketing our own business more. What we weren't expecting, however, was the amount of support that we
								<br>
								had recieved from our Social Media on this decision.

								<strong>'Operation: Orphanos'</strong> proved to be a huge success within the first months of 2024, and as such, improved our social image as well as allowing both our team and <br>
							the Orphans to benefit from our service. Word had spread massively with the two major CSR Activies which we had begun, and as a result, more companies
								<br>
							as well as individuals began donating to our business with hopes that we would do more, which we planned to do.
								<br>
								<br>
							We had released two games this year, both of them with far greater quality graphics, sound design, stroylines etc, and our beloved gamers enjoyed <br>
							every minute of our creations. Our recent game, <strong>'Frozen Honour'</strong>, had also been recognised in a world famous blog called 'Indie Games Now' and had recieved <br>
							a five star rating, which no other game had ever recieved. As such, we've been recognised as well by the CEO of <strong>Rockstar Games</strong> Via Social Mediawhich <br>
							which was a massive honour for a small time Game Developing Company.
