							Whilst talking about more CSR Acts which
							we as a company could do, the topic of
							<em>‘Why not attempt to empower and give
								something back to the children who had
								lost it all?’</em>
							, and thus, Operation: Orphanos
							was born.
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							Operation: Orphanos is when we as a whole go to local Orphanages and give as much as we can
							towards the children to try and inspire them to look forward to a future. There are many
							employees at Hephaestus’ Games Studio who, at a very young age had lost their parents and
							had given up on their future for a long time. Thus, we wanted to try to be the light which
							provides safety and hope for those children who walked down the same path.
							<br>
							<br>
							Unlike Operation: Young Minds, we focus solely on developing their artistic skills and
							thinking by doing activities such as taking their ideas and transforming it in a videogame
							which we would publish, and all profits made from that game would go back towards the
							orphanage.
							<br>
							<br>
							Another would be bringing their art ‘to life’ by having professionals remake it and publish
							both their art and the remade art on social media, as well as have it printed on t-shirts
							which we’d donate to them. We also love doing taking their ideas for toys and other fun
							creations that they’d like, then having them 3D printed and painted exactly to how they’d
							like it to bring their creations to reality.
							<br>
							<br>
							To find out more about which orphanages we support or other information, feel free to

							If there's one thing we here at Hephaestus'
							Games Studio strive to accomplish for the
							entirety of its lifespan, its to inspire and
							cultivate the minds of the youth of today.
							Minds began when the topic of <em>‘How would
								you have like to have started Game Development’</em> was brought about within a
							meeting. The answer? We would have liked to have learned
							<br>about it in High School.
							<br>
							<br>And so, we decided to volunteer our services towards local High schools in order to
							inspire and guide the
							youth who wished to make a career within the Game Development industry. We proposed the idea
							to the Principals, and after plenty of paperwork, we managed to start Game Development Clubs
							within 10 different schools in order to teach the students the basic skills needed to create
							a Video Game, such as 3D Modelling, Character Creation, Basic C# code etc.
							<br>
							<br>
							We provided them with the necessary licensed applications as well as professional resources
							and experienced employees who specialized in those fields.
							To give the students more motivation, we devised a competition where each club would create
							a Video Game to the best of their abilities, and at the end of the year, we would not only
							feature the top three games on our website, but would reward the top three with a cash
							prize.
							<br>
							<br>
							Lastly, to the top fifteen students who put in the most amount of effort into the games
							amongst all the schools, we would provide tuition fees to pay off any field that they desire
							which follows game development, such as Graphic Design etc.
							<br>
							<br>
							In order to find out more about Operation: Young Minds, such as what software or other
							resources we use or which schools we go to, feel free to contact us!
