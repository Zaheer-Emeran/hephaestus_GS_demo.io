This is a Website which I created as a project within my first year at Rosebank College.
The core idea was to create a fictional Game Development Website for a Game Development Company, Hephaestus Games Studio, which I owned.

All of the images within the Photo Gallery of the "Games", Along with the video, has been created by me using Blender.
